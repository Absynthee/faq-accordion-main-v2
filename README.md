## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I decided to revisit this project to make a few changes, most notably replacing the accordion & panel divs with detail & summaries and removing the JavaScript so it is purely CSS. This reduces complexity and makes improves the code semantically.
